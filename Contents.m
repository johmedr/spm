%
% Statistical Parametric Mapping refers to the construction and assessment 
% of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about
% functional imaging data.  These ideas have been instantiated in software 
% that is called SPM.
%
% The  SPM software package has been designed for the analysis of brain 
% imaging data  sequences.  The sequences can be a series of images from 
% different cohorts, or time-series from the same subject.  The current 
% release is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG and MEG.
%
% SPM is developed under the auspices of the Functional Imaging Laboratory
% (FIL) at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, in the Queen Square
% Institute of Neurology at University College London (UCL), UK.
%
% SPM is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
%
% See README.md for details of this release.
